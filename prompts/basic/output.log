Response: The sky appears blue because of the way light interacts with tiny particles in the Earth's atmosphere.

Here's what happens:

1. **Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight travels from the sun to our planet, it contains all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).
2. **Light scatters off tiny particles**: The tiny particles in the atmosphere, like nitrogen and oxygen molecules, scatter the light in all directions.
3. **Shorter wavelengths are scattered more**: Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors of light. As a result, it is scattered more by these tiny particles than longer wavelengths (like red or orange).
4. **Our eyes see the scattered blue light**: When we look up at the sky, our eyes see mostly the blue light that has been scattered in all directions by the atmosphere.

This phenomenon is called Rayleigh scattering, named after the scientist who discovered it. It's similar to how a prism separates white light into its individual colors.

So, in simple terms, the sky appears blue because of the way shorter wavelengths (like blue) are scattered more by tiny particles in the atmosphere, and our eyes see this scattered light when we look up at the sky!
