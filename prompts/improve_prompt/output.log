Okay, so I want to improve the prompt "why is the sky blue?" using the tactics provided. Let me think through how I can approach this.

First, I need to understand what the user is aiming for. They're asking about why the sky appears blue, which is a common question in science. The original prompt is straightforward but might not be detailed enough for a comprehensive answer.

Looking at the tactics, I should start by writing clear instructions. The model needs to know exactly what's being asked and the expected output. So, I'll instruct it to explain why the sky appears blue in simple terms.

Next, including details will help get more relevant answers. I should specify that the explanation should cover the scientific reason without assuming prior knowledge beyond basic understanding. This ensures the model provides a clear and accurate response without overcomplicating things.

I also need to structure the prompt effectively using delimiters for distinct parts. So, I'll separate the question from the instructions. This helps the model understand exactly what's being asked and how to respond.

Additionally, providing examples or analogies can enhance understanding. I should mention how light scatters in the atmosphere, perhaps comparing it to something familiar like a rainbow, but without going into too much detail since the focus is on the sky's blue color.

Using intent classification means identifying that the user's query is about a scientific explanation. So, by explicitly stating the purpose, I can guide the model towards an informative response.

I should also consider the desired length of the output. While it doesn't need to be extremely long, it should cover the main points without being too brief. This balance ensures the answer is thorough yet concise.

Including a summary instruction might help if the initial response is too lengthy. But since I'm focusing on a single prompt, I'll make sure the instructions are clear and direct.

Lastly, giving the model time to think allows it to generate a more thoughtful response. By explicitly mentioning this, I encourage deeper analysis, which can lead to a better explanation of why the sky appears blue.

Putting all these together, I structure the improved prompt to be clear, detailed, and instructive, ensuring that the model provides an accurate and understandable answer.
